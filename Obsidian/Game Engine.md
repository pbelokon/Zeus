Thee JS Game Engine,

The interactive game building engine designed to work on the web

Think about how most of us create ThreeJS scenes: we assign positions manually or use some type of gui to assist us which still going to force use to copy coordinates to code. When you think about making something as complex as games we want to skip that step and allow for faster prototyping and dynamic code generation. Often there is some complex reason for some one to do something in our age and time but I am working on this just to learn and figure things out, gradually i get to do some other tools to help figure out problem in the current project.You can even use it for building ThreeJS snippets.
